\title{Read an ONT modkit bedMethyl file}
\usage{
readBedMethyl(
  bedmethyl,
  mod = "m",
  chunk_size = 5e+06,
  h5file = NULL,
  check_sorted = TRUE,
  fields = c("coverage", "mod_reads")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bedmethyl}{Path to a nanoporetech modkit bedMethyl file (optionally gzipped).}

\item{mod}{Modification code to retain (\code{"m"} or \code{"h"}).}

\item{chunk_size}{Reserved for future use.}

\item{h5file}{Path to the HDF5 file to create. Defaults to a deterministic
path in \code{tempdir()} derived from the input \code{bedmethyl} filename,
so subsequent calls reuse the same file.}

\item{check_sorted}{Logical, check that records are sorted by chrom and chromStart.}

\item{fields}{Character vector of numeric fields to load. Defaults to \code{c("coverage", "mod_reads")}.}
}
\value{
An \code{RBedMethyl} object.
}
\description{
Create an \code{RBedMethyl} object backed by HDF5Array from a nanoporetech
modkit bedMethyl file (headerless).
